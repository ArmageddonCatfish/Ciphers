# Ciphers
Collection of programs in Java that encode and decode input text

Cypher.java is the first version and substitutes each unique character in a file or console-given input with another character from ASCII characters 32-126, then saves the output to a file.

CypherOptimized.java generates new keys in a much more efficient manner, O(N)

TextRandomizer.java doesn't substitute text, but rather puts each character in a file or console-given input at a random index instead
